### New Example Sketches for the Heltec WiFi Lora 32 (V3) board:

#### ADC_Read_Accurate

This project demonstrates how to read accurate voltages using the ADC pins of the Heltec WiFi Lora 32 (V3) board with approximately 1% accuracy.

#### I2C Scanner

This project is a simple example of using the I2C bus. It allows scanning for I2C devices connected to the I2C buses I2C0 and I2C1.

#### LoRa Receiver

This program configures a Heltec board to receive LoRa data at a specific frequency and configuration.

#### LoRa MQTT Bridge fom Node to MQTT-Server

This project demonstrates how to create a LoRa-to-MQTT bridge to publish data.

#### LoRa Transmitter

This program configures the board to send LoRa packets at regular intervals or when the user button is pressed.

#### LoRa MQTT Bridge from MQTT-server to Node 

This project demonstrates how to create a LoRa-to-MQTT bridge to subscribe data.

#### GPS Data Logger

This Arduino project reads GPS data using the **TinyGPS++** library and displays the information on both the serial monitor and an OLED display.
